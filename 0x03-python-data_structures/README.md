# Python data structures

## Python sequences:
This refers to any iterable basic data-structure in Python
there are two main categories any Python sequence fall into
first: is it ordered or unordered?
second: is it mutable or immutable?

### Ordered sequences
Each element of the sequence has a known index and the order in which
the sequence was created is important, and elements can be doublicated
in more than one slot in the sequence.
We can access each element of an ordered sequence using it's index,
but this brings us to another category.
Mutability:
the sequence is called mutable if we can modify its content
ordered and mutable sequence:
This sequences are made in a specefic order and can be modified, examples for that.
lists
lists can hold any type of object inside it, it is not an array, an array is a sequence of some objects from the same type.
Although, it is ok to make a list from the same type, but python will still see it as a list, and it will have the properties of a list.

### Mutable or immutable
